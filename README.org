* shelter

** High priority

- Tsunami shelter and evacuation maps for Taitung
  - [X] Prepare data model to have maps
  - [ ] Download the maps
  - [ ] Fill in metadata, possibly manually
  - [ ] Hook up interface: metadata in list, single map view
- and Hualien

** Prior art

- [[https://www.nfa.gov.tw/cht/index.php?code=list&ids=82]]: barely usable, no search, no “locate nearest”
- [[https://blog.104.com.tw/emergency-evacuation-shelter/]] (yes, literally a blog post, not that much worse than the previous one)
- [[https://adr.npa.gov.tw/]] (air defense only)

** Requirements

- Shelter list with search and filtering
- Find shelters in my area
- Filter shelter by type: earthquake? air strike?
- Evacuation map for the local area
- Mobile first
- +Load fast: main page < 500KiB+
- +Probably: usable without JS+
- Rely on smart client, not smart server. This reduces load during peak events, and hopefully cuts network latency out of the picture once everything is fetched. The server side should probably just be static.

** UI views

- [X] Shelter / evacuation map list
- Shelter / evacuation map info
- Meta (about, license, privacy, funding)

** Tech stack

- Tailwind? Or not for bundle size? Unocss?
- I'm inclined to go with Astro; also use its localization features
- Data collection can be done before build, then the final pages can be static
